Guessing number

It is a 2 player game

Player 1 and player 2 will input a number
One random number is choosen between the range of numbers given by the player. Player 1 will start guessing the number until he guesses correctly.
Again one more random number is genrated between the range of numbers provided by the players, now player2 will guess the number untill he gueses correctly.

So who guess the number with less guesses will be the winner
